Producing a daily broadcast is a lot of fun, but it's also hard work. If you visit riotv.org, you'll see all the fun things that happen in front of the camera, but there is so much more that happens behind the scenes--script writing, filming, graphics, editing, organization, communication, leadership, and teamwork. Students will work during class time, and sometimes at brunch, lunch, and after school creating our show as we pursue our four-point goal to INFORM, ENGAGE, INCLUDE, and INSPIRE. Rio TV is looking for students who are mature, hard-working, and who can work well together as a team. </p>
